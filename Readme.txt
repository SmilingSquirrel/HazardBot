Made by SmilingSquirrel
For BGMC33 (9/24/20 - 10/1/20)

You are a robot.
Your human masters have sent you to enter an old facility in seach of "The End".
There are many traps in the stone structure.
The humans have brought quite a lot of robots with them, hopefully one will make it through!

Controls:

Gamepad: Move-Right Joystick, Jump-"A" Button, Back to menu-"Back" Button
Keyboard: Move-"A" + "D" Key, Jump-"Space" Key, Back to menu-"Esc"
Quit: F4
You can triple jump.



Other notes:
The "robot counter" resets for each level. It does not keep a talley of robots for
   your whole playthrough.

Feel free to post robot counts or playthrough times for levels on the BA thread, if
   you like a little competition.

Due to the difficulty of the game, all levels are accessable from the main menu.

If Steam is running in the background, you may eperience severe frame drops and unwanted
    behavior from your gamepad.
